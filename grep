grep is a command that searches for matching text (or regex) in a specified file and sends the results to the standard output.

Example:
grep hello introduction.txt
This command will search and return all lines containing the word 'hello' in the introduction.txt file.

Example 2:
grep "^B" *.txt
This command will search all text files with regex ^B, which returns all lines which start with 'B'.
